                <h5>WHO IS GENERAL SUN TZU?</h5>
                <h1>THE GREATEST MILITARY STRATEGIST</h1>
                <p>The oldest available sources disagree as to where Sun Tzu was born. The Spring and Autumn Annals and
                    Sima Qian's later Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji) state that Sun Tzu was born in Qi. Both
                    sources also agree that Sun Tzu was born in the late Spring and Autumn period and that he was active
                    as a general and strategist, serving King Helü of Wu in the late sixth century BC, beginning around
                    512 BC. Sun Tzu's victories then inspired him to write The Art of War. The Art of War was one of the
                    most widely read military treatises in the subsequent Warring States period, a time of constant war
                    among seven ancient Chinese states–Zhao, Qi, Qin, Chu, Han, Wei, and Yan–who fought to control the
                    vast expanse of fertile territory in <span>Eastern China.</span></p>
